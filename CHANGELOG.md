# Changelog

All notable changes to Forge are documented in this file.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**API stability promise:** every exported symbol in `github.com/forge-cms/forge`
at v1.0.0 is stable. No breaking changes will be made without a new major version.
The zero-dependency policy and zero-reflection-at-request-time guarantee are
treated as part of the stability promise.

**Architectural rationale:** see [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for the reasoning
behind every design choice. Amendments that changed existing behaviour are
cross-referenced below by their Amendment ID.

---

## [Unreleased]

Changes planned for v2 and beyond are tracked in [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)
under Milestone 10 and the v2+ Roadmap section.

---

## [1.1.6] — 2026-03-20

`/_health` now reports framework versions sourced from the binary's embedded
build info; the application-supplied `"version"` key is removed (Amendment A58).
`App.Run()` emits a startup log line with the same version data before
`ListenAndServe`.

### Changed

- `forge.go`: `App.Health()` response no longer includes the `"version"` key
  driven by `Config.Version`; instead, `forgeVersions()` reads
  `runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo()` at mount time and injects `"forge"` (and
  any companion-module keys such as `"forge_mcp"`) into the JSON — e.g.
  `{"status":"ok","forge":"1.1.6","forge_mcp":"1.0.5"}` (Amendment A58)
- `forge.go`: `App.Run()` calls `forgeVersions()` before starting
  `ListenAndServe` and emits a startup line to stderr, e.g.
  `forge: forge 1.1.6, forge_mcp 1.0.5` (Amendment A58)
- `forge.go`: `Config.Version` godoc updated — the field is retained for
  application authors but is no longer consumed by any built-in Forge endpoint
  (Amendment A58)

---

## [1.1.5] — 2026-03-20

`SQLRepo` now double-quotes all generated SQL identifiers, fixing runtime SQL
syntax errors when `db` tag values collide with reserved keywords such as
`order`, `group`, or `index` (Amendment A57).

### Fixed

- `storage.go`: `quoteIdent()` helper added; applied to every generated column
  reference in `SQLRepo.Save`, `FindAll`, `FindByID`, `FindBySlug`, and
  `Delete`; previously unquoted identifiers caused SQL syntax errors when a
  `db` struct tag used a reserved keyword (e.g. `db:"order"`) (Amendment A57)

---

## [1.1.4] — 2026-03-20

Add `forge.AbsURL(base, path string) string` helper for building absolute URLs
in `Head()` implementations (Amendment A56).

### Added

- `head.go`: `AbsURL(base, path string) string` — trims any trailing slash from
  `base`, passes `path` through `URL()` for normalisation, and concatenates;
  intended for use in `Head()` implementations when setting `Head.Canonical`,
  `Head.Image.URL`, or any other field that requires an absolute URL
  (Amendment A56)

---

## [1.1.3] — 2026-03-18

`negotiate()` now returns `text/html` when `Accept` is absent or `*/*` and
the module has templates configured, ensuring crawlers see HTML with structured
data in `<head>` (Amendment A53).

### Fixed

- `module.go`: `negotiate()` now returns `text/html` when `Accept` is
  absent or `*/*` and the module has templates configured; previously
  returned `application/json` unconditionally for these cases, causing
  Google Search Console and other crawlers to receive JSON instead of
  HTML and never see structured data in `<head>` (Amendment A53)

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-17

`[]string` fields in content types are now correctly typed as `"array"` in
`MCPSchema` and MCP tool schemas; comma-separated string values from MCP clients
are automatically coerced to slices (Amendment A52).

### Fixed

- `module.go`: `mcpGoTypeStr` now returns `"array"` for `reflect.Slice` kinds;
  previously fell through to `"string"`, causing MCP clients to advertise and send a
  plain string for `[]string` fields which `json.Unmarshal` silently discarded
  (Amendment A52-1)
- `module.go`: new `coerceSliceFields` helper splits comma-separated string values
  for `[]string` struct fields before the `Marshal→Unmarshal` round-trip in
  `MCPCreate` and `MCPUpdate`, tolerating MCP clients that serialise multi-value
  fields as comma strings (Amendment A52-3)
- `forge-mcp/mcp.go`: `inputSchema` and `inputSchemaUpdate` now emit
  `{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}` for array fields instead of
  `{"type":"array"}`, and suppress `minLength`/`maxLength`/`enum` constraints that
  apply to string entries but not arrays (Amendment A52-2)

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-03-17

`forge:head` now emits the correct `twitter:card` value for article and product
content types (Amendment A51).

### Fixed

- `templates.go`: `forgeHeadTmpl` now emits `twitter:card = summary_large_image`
  when `Head.Type` is `"Article"` or `"Product"`, even when no image is provided;
  previously only a non-empty `Head.Image.URL` triggered the large-image card,
  causing OG/Twitter scrapers to render a small summary card for article-type
  content; `Head.Social.Twitter.Card` explicit override continues to take
  priority over the derived value (Amendment A51)

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-17

`forge-mcp` — MCP support shipped (Milestone 10). New exported symbols in
forge core enabling AI assistants to discover and operate on content modules
via the Model Context Protocol.

### Added

- `mcp.go`: `MCPOperation` type; `MCPRead`, `MCPWrite` constants; `MCP(...)`
  option function; `MCPMeta` struct (`Prefix`, `TypeName`, `Operations`);
  `MCPField` struct (`Name`, `JSONName`, `Type`, `Required`, `MinLength`,
  `MaxLength`, `Enum`); `MCPModule` interface (`MCPMeta()`, `MCPSchema()`,
  `MCPList()`, `MCPGet()`, `MCPCreate()`, `MCPUpdate()`, `MCPPublish()`,
  `MCPSchedule()`, `MCPArchive()`, `MCPDelete()`)
- `module.go`: `Module[T]` implements `MCPModule` — all nine operations
  delegating to the existing repo, validation, signal, and lifecycle layers
- `forge.go`: `App.MCPModules() []MCPModule` — returns modules registered
  with `MCP(...)`
- `auth.go`: `VerifyBearerToken(r *http.Request, secret []byte) (User, error)`
  — validates HMAC Bearer tokens for SSE transport (Amendment A50)
- `context.go`: `NewContextWithUser(user User) Context` — production-safe
  background context for use by transport layers (Amendment A50)
- `forge.go`: `App.Secret() []byte` — exposes the app secret for transport
  layer token verification (Amendment A50)

---

## [1.0.11] — 2026-03-15

Manually published items now get a correct `PublishedAt` timestamp.

### Fixed

- `module.go`: `updateHandler` now sets `PublishedAt` to the current UTC time
  and re-saves when the status transitions to `Published`; previously
  `PublishedAt` remained at zero for all items published via PUT; the scheduler
  path was already correct (Amendment A48)

---

## [1.0.10] — 2026-03-15

`forge_markdown` now delegates to `renderMarkdown`, gaining full table support.

### Fixed

- `templatehelpers.go`: `forgeMarkdown` replaced with a one-line delegation to
  `renderMarkdown`; the `forge_markdown` template function now renders GFM
  tables, language-tagged fenced code blocks, `<hr>`, and all other elements
  supported by `renderMarkdown`; the previous stub had no table parsing
  (Amendment A47)

---

## [1.0.9] — 2026-03-15

Minimal Markdown→HTML renderer added to `TemplateFuncMap` with zero
dependencies.

### Added

- `markdown.go`: `renderMarkdown(s string) template.HTML` — XSS-safe
  Markdown→HTML converter supporting h1–h6, fenced code blocks with
  `class="language-〈lang〉"`, unordered lists, GFM tables, `**bold**`,
  `` `inline code` ``, blank-line `<p>` paragraphs, and `---` as `<hr>`;
  all content HTML-entity-escaped before tag wrapping; zero third-party
  dependencies (Amendment A46)
- `templatehelpers.go`: `TemplateFuncMap()` gains `"markdown"` key backed by
  `renderMarkdown`; existing `"forge_markdown"` is unchanged (Amendment A46)

---

## [1.0.8] — 2026-03-15

  Default authentication wired automatically in `New()`. Silent misconfiguration
  where a developer sets `Config.Secret` and uses `SignToken` but forgets to call
  `app.Use(forge.Authenticate(...))` now produces a working app instead of 403 on
  every write request.

  ### Added

  - `forge.go`: `Config.Auth AuthFunc` field — the `AuthFunc` used to authenticate
    all requests; when nil, Forge defaults to `BearerHMAC(Config.Secret)`
    automatically (Amendment A45)
  - `forge.go`: `New()` now prepends `Authenticate(auth)` as the first middleware in
    the app stack; replaces the need to call `app.Use(forge.Authenticate(...))`
    manually for the default bearer-token use case (Amendment A45)

  ### Changed

  - `Config.Secret` godoc updated to note that it drives the default `BearerHMAC`
    auth when `Config.Auth` is nil (Amendment A45)

---

## [1.0.7] — 2026-03-15

Bug fix: SQLRepo now correctly handles content types that embed `forge.Node`
or any other anonymous (embedded) struct.

### Fixed

- `storage.go`: `dbFields` / `collectDBFields` — `dbField.index` changed from
  `int` to `[]int` (reflect field index path); new recursive helper
  `collectDBFields` flattens promoted fields from embedded structs so that
  `SQLRepo.Save` no longer passes a raw struct value as a SQL argument
  (`"unsupported type forge.Node, a struct"`). All callers updated to use
  `reflect.Value.FieldByIndex` (Amendment A44)

---

## [1.0.6] — 2026-03-12

Health endpoint and application version field.

### Added

- `forge.go`: `Config.Version string` field — when non-empty, included in the
  `GET /_health` response as `{"status":"ok","version":"X.Y.Z"}`
- `forge.go`: `App.Health()` method — mounts `GET /_health`; explicit opt-in,
  not auto-mounted; returns `200 application/json`; no authentication required
  (Amendment A42)

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-03-12

Hardening sweep: WriteError pipeline, SignToken error type, goroutine lifecycle,
debounce context correctness, and API naming consistency. All `http.Error`/`http.NotFound`
bypasses replaced, cache sweep goroutine terminates on graceful shutdown, debounce
callback no longer uses a cancelled request context, and two API symbols renamed for
convention consistency. No breaking changes except `FeedDisabled()` →
`DisableFeed()` (Amendment A40).

### Fixed

- `redirects.go`: `http.NotFound` and `http.Error(410)` bypasses replaced with
  `WriteError(w, r, ErrNotFound)` / `WriteError(w, r, ErrGone)` (Amendment A37)
- `redirectmanifest.go`: `http.Error(401)` bypass replaced with
  `WriteError(w, r, ErrUnauth)` (Amendment A37)
- `cookiemanifest.go`: `http.Error(401)` bypass replaced with
  `WriteError(w, r, ErrUnauth)` (Amendment A37)
- `sitemap.go`: `http.NotFound` and `http.Error(500)` bypasses replaced with
  `WriteError(w, r, ErrNotFound)` / `WriteError(w, r, ErrInternal)` (Amendment A37)
- `auth.go` (`encodeToken`): unreachable `json.Marshal` error path returned raw
  `fmt.Errorf`; returns `ErrInternal` (satisfies `forge.Error`, Amendment A38)
- `module.go` (cache sweep goroutine): goroutine spawned by `NewModule` had no
  exit path and leaked across graceful shutdown and test runs; now exits via
  `stopCh` select branch (Amendment A39)
- `module.go` (debounce callback): stashed request `Context` was cancelled before
  the 2-second debounce fired; `SQLRepo` queries silently failed on every write
  event in production; callback now builds `NewBackgroundContext(m.siteName)` at
  fire time; `debounceMu`/`debounceCtx` fields removed; `triggerSitemap(ctx)`
  renamed to `triggerRebuild()` (Amendment A41)
- `example/blog/main.go`: index template error handler used `http.Error`;
  corrected to `forge.WriteError(w, r, forge.ErrInternal)`

### Added

- `Module[T].Stop()`: exported idempotent method that closes `stopCh` (halts
  cache sweep goroutine) and calls `debounce.Stop()` (Amendment A39)
- `debouncer.Stop()`: cancels any pending `time.AfterFunc` timer (Amendment A39)
- `App.Run()` calls `Stop()` on all registered modules after `srv.Shutdown`
  returns; `stoppable` interface added (Amendment A39)

### Changed

- `FeedDisabled()` renamed to `DisableFeed()` for naming convention consistency
  (`forge.Verb(Noun)` pattern); `feedDisabledOption` internal type unchanged
  (Amendment A40)
- `forgeLLMSEntries` (unexported) renamed to `forgeLLMsEntries` to match
  `LLMsStore`/`LLMsEntry` casing convention; template tag `forge_llms_entries`
  is unchanged (Amendment A40)

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-03-11

Fenced code block rendering, content negotiation capability gating (A35),
startup capability mismatch detection (A36), and example fixes. `forge_markdown` renders ` ``` `…` ``` ` fences as `<pre><code>`.
`negotiate()` now falls back to JSON instead of 406 when a client requests
`text/html` or `text/markdown` but the module lacks templates or `Markdownable`.
Both examples gain full working links on their welcome pages. No breaking API changes.

### Fixed

- `forge_markdown` / `forgeMarkdown` did not handle fenced code blocks; content
  between ` ``` ` fences was emitted as plain paragraph text; now rendered as
  `<pre><code>` with HTML escaping applied (XSS-safe)
- `module.go` content negotiation (`negotiate()`): returned `text/html` or
  `text/markdown` even when the module lacked templates / `Markdownable`; browsers
  and `Accept: text/html` clients received 406 Not Acceptable on JSON-only modules;
  fixed by gating on `n.html` and `n.md` capability flags instead of falling back
  to unsupported formats (Amendment A35)
- `example/docs`: module had no `SitemapConfig` option; `/docs/sitemap.xml` returned
  404; `forge.SitemapConfig{}` added to the module
- `example/docs/templates/index.html`: footer linked to `/docs/sitemap.xml`
  (404); corrected to `/sitemap.xml` (aggregate index)
- `example/api`: welcome page links to `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`,
  `/resources/sitemap.xml`, `/resources/feed.xml`, and `/robots.txt` returned
  404 or 406; module now includes `SitemapConfig{}`, `Feed(FeedConfig{...})`,
  `AIIndex(LLMsTxt, LLMsTxtFull)` options and `app.SEO(&RobotsConfig{Sitemaps: true})`
- `example/api`: `Resource` lacked `Head() Head`, so it did not satisfy
  `SitemapNode`; `regenerateSitemap` exited early; `/resources/sitemap.xml`
  returned 404; `Head()` added returning `forge.Head{Title: r.Title}`
- `example/api`: `Redirects(From("/resources/go-spec"), ...)` was registered as a
  fallback at `GET /`, but `GET /resources/{slug}` matched first; fixed by adding
  an explicit `app.Handle("GET /resources/go-spec", http.RedirectHandler(..., 301))`
  so the fixed-path pattern takes mux priority over the wildcard

### Added

- `module.go` (`NewModule`): two startup panics detect capability mismatches before
  any request is served (Amendment A36):
  - `SitemapConfig{}` given but `T` does not implement `SitemapNode` (missing
    `Head() forge.Head`) → panic with actionable message; previously `regenerateSitemap`
    exited silently and `/{prefix}/sitemap.xml` was always empty
  - `AIIndex(LLMsTxtFull)` given but `T` does not implement `Markdownable` (missing
    `Markdown() string`) → panic with actionable message; previously `/llms-full.txt`
    contained empty entries silently

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-03-11

Startup rebuild for derived content. Sitemap fragments, RSS feeds, and AI index
entries are now populated from existing repository data at server start, so apps
with seed data or pre-loaded fixtures no longer require a manual publish event
to see correct output. No breaking API changes. (Amendment A34)

### Fixed

- `Module[T]` sitemap, feed, and AI index were only populated by the debouncer
  after a create/update/publish signal; items inserted directly into the
  repository (seed data, fixtures) never triggered regeneration; `App.Handler`
  now launches a one-shot goroutine that calls `rebuildAll` on every module
  after all stores are wired up (A34)

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-03-11

Route mounting order fix. `GET /{prefix}/sitemap.xml` and `GET /{prefix}/feed.xml`
were never mounted because the guards in `Module.Register` checked the store pointer,
which is injected *after* `Register` returns. No breaking API changes. (Amendment A33)

### Fixed

- `Module[T].Register` guarded sitemap and feed route mounting on `m.sitemapStore != nil`
  and `m.feedStore != nil` respectively; both stores are always `nil` at registration
  time because `App.Content` calls `Register` before `setSitemap`/`setFeedStore`; routes
  are now mounted when the *config* is present and the store is read lazily at request
  time (A33)

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-11

Error handling pipeline hardening. All six `http.Error` bypass sites removed;
four missing sentinels added; `errorTemplateLookup` race fixed; `Recoverer`
stack buffer increased. No breaking API changes. (Amendments A29–A32)

### Added

- `ErrBadRequest` (400 `bad_request`), `ErrNotAcceptable` (406 `not_acceptable`),
  `ErrRequestTooLarge` (413 `request_too_large`), `ErrTooManyRequests`
  (429 `too_many_requests`) sentinel errors — complete the framework's own
  HTTP status vocabulary (A29)
- `setErrorTemplateLookup` / `runErrorTemplateLookup` internal helpers that
  wrap `errorTemplateLookup` in a `sync.RWMutex`, eliminating the data race
  between `App.Handler()` start-up and in-flight requests (A29)
- `ERROR_HANDLING.md` — authoritative strategy document for error handling;
  required reading before any code that calls `WriteError` or adds a sentinel

### Fixed

- `respond()` used a direct type assertion `err.(*ValidationError)` instead of
  `errors.As`; a wrapped `*ValidationError` would have silently produced a 422
  response without field details (A29)
- `writeContent` had no `*http.Request`, forcing 406 responses via `http.Error`
  (plain text, no `X-Request-ID`); now receives `r *http.Request` and calls
  `WriteError(w, r, ErrNotAcceptable)` (A30)
- JSON decode failures in `createHandler` and `updateHandler` called
  `http.Error` (plain text, no `X-Request-ID`, always 400); now calls
  `WriteError` with `ErrRequestTooLarge` (413) when `*http.MaxBytesError` is
  detected, otherwise `ErrBadRequest` (400) (A30)
- `renderListHTML` and `renderShowHTML` called `http.Error` for nil template;
  now calls `WriteError(w, r, ErrNotAcceptable)` (A31)
- `RateLimit` called `http.Error` for 429 rate-limit responses (plain text, no
  `X-Request-ID`); now calls `WriteError(w, r, ErrTooManyRequests)` (A32)
- `Recoverer` stack capture buffer was 4096 bytes; deep stacks (recursive
  templates, chained middleware) were silently truncated; increased to 32 KB (A32)

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-08

v1.0.0 stabilisation: test coverage audit, benchmarks, godoc pass, and three
reference example applications.

### Added

- `go test ./... -cover` coverage raised to ≥ 85%; targeted additions for
  `App.RedirectStore`, `TrustedProxy`, `CacheStore.Sweep`, `RedirectStore.Len`,
  `stripMarkdown`, `forgeLLMSEntries`
- `benchmarks_test.go`: 17 benchmarks covering hot paths across M1–M8;
  results in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md)
- Godoc improved on `type App` and all `App.*` methods (A18–A26); `SQLRepo[T]`
  method comments brought to parity with `MemoryRepo[T]`
- `example/blog/`: standalone blog — `Post` type, `SitemapConfig`, `Social`,
  `FeedConfig`, `AIIndex`, `On[*Post](AfterPublish)`, scheduled publishing
- `example/docs/`: standalone docs site — `Doc` type, `Headable`,
  `Markdownable`, `AIDocSummary`, `AIIndex(LLMsTxt, LLMsTxtFull, AIDoc)`,
  `RobotsConfig{AIScraper: AskFirst}`
- `example/api/`: standalone JSON API — `Resource` type, `Authenticate` +
  `BearerHMAC`, `Auth(Read(Guest), Write(Editor))`, `On[T](BeforeCreate)`,
  `Redirects`, `SecurityHeaders`, `RateLimit`

### Changed (Amendment A27)

- `middleware.go`: `Authenticate(auth AuthFunc) func(http.Handler) http.Handler`
  — middleware that populates `Context.User()` from an `AuthFunc` on every
  request; enables `Module[T]` role enforcement in production. Pairs with
  `BearerHMAC`, `CookieSession`, or `AnyAuth`.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-03-07

Scheduled publishing: automatic `Scheduled→Published` transition with signal
dispatch, sitemap regeneration, and feed rebuild.

### Added

- `scheduler.go`: `Scheduler` type, adaptive ticker (next-due interval, 60 s
  fallback), `schedulableModule` interface
- `module.go`: `Module[T].processScheduled` — transitions Scheduled items whose
  `ScheduledAt` is past to Published, assigns `PublishedAt`, fires `AfterPublish`,
  triggers sitemap and feed regeneration (Amendment A25)
- `forge.go`: `App` starts the scheduler before `ListenAndServe` and stops it
  after `srv.Shutdown` (Amendment A26)
- `NewBackgroundContext(host string) Context` — zero-value Context for use
  outside the HTTP request cycle, e.g. in scheduler callbacks (Amendment A24)

### Changed (Amendments A23, A25)

- `node.go`: `Node` time fields (`PublishedAt`, `ScheduledAt`, `CreatedAt`,
  `UpdatedAt`) carry `db:"..."` struct tags for `SQLRepo[T]` column mapping
  (Amendment A23)

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-07

Production-ready SQL repository, redirect enforcement, chain collapse, and the
`/.well-known/redirects.json` inspect endpoint.

### Added

- `storage.go`: `SQLRepo[T any]` — production `Repository[T]` backed by
  `forge.DB`; struct-tag column mapping cached in `sync.Map`; `Table()` option
  for custom table names; full CRUD + `FindAll`/`FindBySlug` (Amendment A19)
- `redirects.go`: `RedirectCode` (`Permanent`, `Temporary`, `Gone`),
  `RedirectEntry`, `From` named type, `Redirects` module option, `RedirectStore`
  with O(1) exact + prefix lookups, chain collapse, optional DB persistence,
  `App.Redirect()`, `RedirectStore.Len()` (Amendments A20, A21)
- `redirectmanifest.go`: `/.well-known/redirects.json` always mounted, live
  serialisation of `RedirectStore`, `App.RedirectManifestAuth()` (Amendment A22)
- `forge.go`: `"/"` fallback handler wired from `redirectStore.handler()`
  (Amendment A20)

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-07

Cookie consent enforcement and `/.well-known/cookies.json` compliance manifest.

### Added

- `cookies.go`: `CookieCategory` (`Necessary`, `Preferences`, `Analytics`,
  `Marketing`), `Cookie`, `SetCookie`, `SetCookieIfConsented`, `ReadCookie`,
  `ClearCookie`, `GrantConsent`, `RevokeConsent`, `ConsentFor`
- `cookiemanifest.go`: `/.well-known/cookies.json` typed JSON manifest,
  `ManifestAuth` option, `App.Cookies()`, `App.CookiesManifestAuth()`
  (Amendment A18)

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-06

Open Graph, Twitter Cards, AI indexing (llms.txt + AIDoc), and opt-in RSS feeds.

### Added

- `social.go`: `Social` module option, `OpenGraph`, `TwitterCard`, card-type
  constants, `SocialOverrides`; `forge:head` partial renders OG and Twitter Card
  `<meta>` tags automatically when Social is registered
- `ai.go`: `AIIndex` module option; `LLMsTxt`, `LLMsTxtFull`, `AIDoc` flags;
  `LLMsStore`; `/llms.txt` compact index; `/llms-full.txt` full markdown corpus
  (requires `Markdownable`); `/{prefix}/{slug}/aidoc` per-item endpoint
  (requires `Markdownable`); `AIDocSummary` interface; `WithoutID` option;
  gzip compression in AI handlers (Amendment A17)
- `feed.go`: `Feed` module option, `FeedConfig`, `FeedDisabled`;
  `/{prefix}/feed.xml` per-module RSS 2.0; `/feed.xml` aggregate index;
  signal-driven regeneration (Amendment A16)

### Changed

- `Markdownable` interface (`Markdown() string`) moved from `module.go` to
  `ai.go`; consumed by `/llms-full.txt` and `/{slug}/aidoc`

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-05

HTML rendering, template helpers, and content negotiation.

### Added

- `templatedata.go`: `TemplateData[T any]` (`Content`, `Head`, `User`,
  `Request`, `SiteName`), `NewTemplateData`
- `templates.go`: `Templates(dir)` / `TemplatesOptional(dir)` module options;
  `forge:head` partial (title, meta description, canonical, OG, Twitter Card,
  JSON-LD); error page template `forge:error`; HTML render path for list + show
- `templatehelpers.go`: `forge_meta`, `forge_date`, `forge_rfc3339`,
  `forge_markdown`, `forge_excerpt`, `forge_csrf_token`, `forge_llms_entries`;
  `TemplateFuncMap()` export

### Changed (Amendments A6, A7, A8, P3)

- Templates parsed once at `app.Run()` / `app.Handler()` startup; missing
  template files cause fast-fail (Amendment P3)
- `forge:head` emits `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD when `Head.Breadcrumbs` is
  non-empty (Amendment A8)
- Error pages rendered via `forge:error` when available; fallback to
  `WriteError` plain text (Amendments A6, A7)

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-03

SEO metadata, JSON-LD structured data, per-module sitemaps, and robots.txt.

### Added

- `head.go`: `Head`, `Image`, `Excerpt`, `Crumb`, `Crumbs`, `Breadcrumb`,
  `Headable` interface, `HeadFunc` module option
- `schema.go`: JSON-LD types — `Article`, `Product`, `FAQPage`, `HowTo`,
  `Event`, `Recipe`, `Review`, `Organization`, `BreadcrumbList`; `SchemaOf`
  serialises to `<script type="application/ld+json">`
- `sitemap.go`: per-module `/{prefix}/sitemap.xml`, `/sitemap.xml` aggregate
  index, `SitemapConfig` option, `SitemapStore`, `SitemapPrioritiser`
  interface, debounce-driven async regeneration (Amendment P1)
- `robots.go`: auto-generated `robots.txt`, `RobotsConfig`, `AskFirst` /
  `Disallow` AI-crawler policy constants, `App.SEO()`

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-02

App bootstrap, HTTP server, graceful shutdown, and the `forge-pgx` companion
module.

### Added

- `forge.go`: `Config`, `MustConfig`, `New`, `App` (`Use`, `Content`, `Handle`,
  `Run`, `Handler`), `Registrator` interface, graceful shutdown on
  `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`
- `forge-pgx` (`github.com/forge-cms/forge-pgx`): `forgepgx.Wrap(*pgxpool.Pool)
  forge.DB` — pgx/v5 adapter; no generated code, no ORM

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-01

Foundation: the minimum needed to build a real application.
Zero third-party dependencies. All types in package `forge`.

## Version policy

Forge uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

- **MAJOR** — breaking change to any exported symbol in `github.com/forge-cms/forge`
- **MINOR** — new exported symbols; backward-compatible amendments
- **PATCH** — bug fixes with no API change

v1.0.0 and all future v1.x releases maintain full backward compatibility.
A v2 will be introduced as a separate import path
(`github.com/forge-cms/forge/v2`) following Go module conventions.

See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for the architectural rationale behind every
design choice in this release.
