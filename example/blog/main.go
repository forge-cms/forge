simple: zero third-party dependencies in the core package. Every Go developer
has seen it — a promising framework that pulls in a dependency graph the size of
a small city, pins you to one logging library, one router, one database layer.

Go's standard library is remarkably complete. net/http gives you a
production-ready HTTP server. html/template handles safe rendering.
encoding/xml covers RSS. database/sql abstracts every relational database.
We asked ourselves what third-party code would add that justified the cost —
version conflicts, supply chain risk, upgrade treadmills — and answered:
nothing we actually needed.

The constraint paid dividends immediately. Forge builds in under two seconds.
go test ./... runs in under a second with no network fetches. You can vendor it
with a single go mod vendor and never worry about left-pad moments. Zero
dependencies is not a marketing claim; it is a design principle that makes
every downstream project more maintainable.`,

job queue: Redis, Sidekiq, Celery, BullMQ. These work, but they introduce
infrastructure you have to operate, monitor, and keep in sync with your
application state. We wanted something you could run on a single binary with no
external dependencies.

Forge uses an adaptive in-process ticker. When the scheduler starts it looks at
the nearest ScheduledAt timestamp across all modules and sets its tick interval
to half the remaining time, down to a minimum of one second. If nothing is
scheduled the interval falls back to 60 seconds. This means a post scheduled
one minute in the future fires within a second of its target time, while a
post scheduled a week away barely touches the CPU.

On each tick the scheduler calls processScheduled on each module, queries the
repository for items in Scheduled status with ScheduledAt in the past,
transitions them to Published, sets PublishedAt, and fires AfterPublish.
The whole operation is synchronous and runs well under a millisecond for
typical content volumes. No queue, no worker, no operations burden.`,

website's content. The format is deliberately simple: a markdown file at
/llms.txt with a list of links and one-line descriptions. Forge implements it
natively — just pass AIIndex(LLMsTxt) as a module option and Forge handles
the rest.

Internally, Forge maintains a LLMsStore that accumulates entries as modules
register themselves. Each entry carries a title, URL, and summary. Forge derives
the summary from the content type's AISummary() method if the type implements
AIDocSummary, or falls back to the first 160 characters of the plain-text
excerpt. The /llms.txt handler renders the store in the standard compact format.

We also support /llms-full.txt, an opt-in endpoint that concatenates the full
markdown representation of every Published item. This gives AI assistants a
single request that yields the entire content corpus — useful for RAG pipelines
and for AI assistants that want to answer questions about your documentation
without repeated fetches.`,

not the application level. A Draft item returns 404 on public endpoints. A
Scheduled item is invisible until its ScheduledAt time passes. An Archived item
is preserved in storage but excluded from all public lists.

This matters because lifecycle enforcement is the kind of logic that is trivial
to implement once, catastrophic to forget. We have all seen staging content
accidentally published, deleted posts returning 200s, draft articles indexed by
Google. Forge makes the correct behaviour the only available behaviour —
developers cannot forget to check status because the check does not exist in
application code; it exists in the framework.

The lifecycle also integrates with signals. AfterPublish fires whenever an item
transitions to Published, whether that happens via an API call or via the
scheduled publisher. This gives you one place to hook logging, cache warming,
webhook dispatch, and notification delivery — regardless of how the publish
happened.`,

(GET /posts/{slug}), named path parameters via r.PathValue, and precedence
rules that make tighter patterns win over looser ones. For a content framework
that generates a fixed set of routes per module — list, show, create, update,
delete, feed, sitemap, aidoc — the standard mux covers everything we need.

Third-party routers offer features like regex constraints, middleware per-route,
and automatic OPTIONS handling. We do not need any of these. Forge handles
middleware at the module and app level, not the route level. Regex constraints
on slugs would complicate the URL scheme without benefit.

Using the standard mux also means zero extra import, zero compatibility risk
with future Go versions, and instant familiarity for any Go developer who reads
the framework source. When the answer is already in the standard library,
adding a dependency is not a trade-off — it is a mistake.`,

Milestone 9 added systematic benchmark coverage across all eight milestone
layers, a godoc pass ensuring every exported symbol has a doc comment, three
example applications (blog, docs, API), and a CHANGELOG tracing every decision
from v0.1.0 to v1.0.0. The result is a framework you can read end-to-end in an
afternoon and trust in production on day one.
